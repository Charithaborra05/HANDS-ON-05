Heap Implementation
This project uses Python to construct a generic Heap class.

This Python version is compatible with:

a general-purpose heap structure that supports a variety of data types (floats, ints, and custom data structures).
The min-heap attribute states that the root is always the smallest element.
Operations on heaps:
adding fresh components to the heap.
removing the root element and adding the heap attribute back.
creating a min-heap out of a random or unsorted array.
Retrieving the root element of the heap without removal.
